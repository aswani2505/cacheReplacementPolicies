1) Download and extract the .zip file to a particular location.
2) The .zip file contains
	- LRU.java 
	- ARC.java 
	- Project_3.sh 
	- P3.lis 
	- P4.lis
3) To run the code all these files must be in the same location.
4) Open the terminal and navigate to this folder.
5) Now to execute the script file type this command in your terminal window
	- sh Project3.sh
6) The two java files will be compiled.
7) First LRU will start executing and prompt the user for the cache size and file name. Give the inputs respectively. Remember to give the full path of the trace file for the file name. eg: /afs/asu.edu/users/a/s/w/aswani/CEN_502_PROJECT_3/P3.lis/
8) The outputs for LRU will be displayed.
9) Now ARC will start running and again prompt the user for the cache size and file name. Do the same procedure as in step 7.
10) The outputs for ARC will be displayed.
11) Match the results obtained with those in the report.
